# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print("bader")
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(4+4)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
print(3*4)
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
length = 5
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
width = 3
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
area = length*width
print( f"the result is {area}")
# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
